Hi, I am Manish (*pronounced Mun-eesh*). I'm a 23 years old Computer Science geek living in New Delhi, India. I work predominantly 
as a server-side engineer, but I also like to dabble in other facets of programming, like front-end,
mobile, and systems programming.

For work, I use Python and Javascript as my primary tools, although I like to play around with 
a multitude of other languages as well. I code in Vim and Sublime Text, with a dash of Emacs!
