As 2014 wraps up, I thought it would be nice to document how the year was for
me, figure out how far I got in accomplishing the goals I set out for myself
last year, and what my general plans are for the year to come.

### Last year's resolutions

- Get Fit. <span style="color: red">[FAILED]</span>
- Earn more money. <span style="color: green">[PASSED]</span>

So I'm halfway there! As always, lazyness got the better of me and I did not
spend time doing any sort of exercise at all. I am determined to change that in
2015 though.

This year was the official start of my professional career as a web
applications developer. I started out working on building the product of an up
and coming startup, which is slowly making waves in India and recently got a
big round of funding. I am now working for another startup in the Enterprise
world.

I entertained thoughts of entering a grad school in the US and hence, took the
GRE exam. I scored a moderate 317 out of 340, which isn't bad. I might re-take
the test to improve my score in 2015.

Didn't learn a whole host of new and exciting technologies this year, however.
I tinkered around with Ruby, Rails, GoLang etc, but never did anything serious
in them. 2014 was quite boring code-wise, with just Python and Javascript being
the primary things in my toolkit. Although I did get better in using those
tools. My project planning and workflow has considerably improved as well. I
also did projects on Google App Engine, dabbled in Docker at work and tried out
Emacs + Racket at home.

Apart from work, I also enjoyed this year quite a bit! My social life has
improved quite a bit from last year. Didn't date a whole lot.

###Good books I read this year:

- [Words of Radiance] by Brandon Sanderson.
- [And the Mountains Echoed](/review/books/2014/08/24/book-review-and-the-mountains-echoed/) by Khalid Housseni.
- [Lolita](/review/books/2014/08/08/book-review-lolita/) by Vladimir Nabokov.

###Places I visited:

- [Bangalore] for PyCon India. 
- [Rishikesh] on a road trip with friends, did Rafting and Trekking.


2015 will be significant. I plan to make some significant changes in my life
(not all of which I'll mention here of course). A major change that I will
mention is that I plan to get serious about my health this year.

### New Goals for 2015 (in no particular order)

- Start cycling or running regularly.
- Read more technical books.
- Earn more money. (This goal will be in every list I make!)
- Visit more places inside the country.
- Visit another country.
- Learn a new language - Spanish or German.
- Become competent in another programming language and its ecosystem.
- Ship more code.
- Publish more blog posts (including the currently half-baked ones).
- Move (I can't do another year of 3+ hrs daily commute).

That's about it. Lets see how many of those I succeed at.

Happy New Year!
