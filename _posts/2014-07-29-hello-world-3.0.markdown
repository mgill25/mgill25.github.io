Yet another avatar of my website. I finally gave in and set up Jekyll
as my blogging engine. I shall be working on a re-design of this website 
pretty soon as well. Meanwhile, let me continue the tradition long held
by programmers when starting something anew and greet any and all visitors
to this website--

{% highlight python %}
print("Hello, World!")
#=> Because why not?!?
{% endhighlight %}

[code] section to see the latest projects that I have been cooking up.
